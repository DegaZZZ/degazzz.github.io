<div style="text-align: justify">
This project explores the properties and distribution of exoplanet candidates using the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) dataset. Analyzing the class distribution, orbital periods, magnitude distribution, correlation matrix, right ascension and declination, and KOI scores, valuable insights are gained. The findings reveal the prevalence of shorter orbital periods for confirmed planets, a bi-modal magnitude distribution, variations in stellar density based on celestial coordinates, and confidence levels of planet candidates.

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I developed a CatBoost Classifier model to predict outcomes of Dota 2 matches, a complex task due to the game's dynamic environment. Despite these challenges, my model showcased strong performance, achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.80Â±0.0053, indicating its ability to accurately differentiate between wins and losses. This project highlights my capability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios, providing reliable predictive insights.
