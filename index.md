A Data Science Project made in Aalto University for a task right from OP representatives. Most of the Data Engineering in this project was done by me. <b>Dash</b> and <b>FastAPI</b> are wrapped into a single <b>Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (AGSI)</b> which is hosted on Heroku using Uvicorn as a server. <b>BigQuery</b> is used for storing all the table datasets that were used during the development of the project and analytics. Connections to the database can be made via an API. The latter also contains some very useful methods. Documentation for the API exists, but currently is not available (soon will be added). Active usage of latest and most powerful <b>GIS</b> techonologies. A demo map is available via a URL on GitHub page or by clicking a badge above.

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project explores the properties and distribution of exoplanet candidates using the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) dataset. Analyzing the class distribution, orbital periods, magnitude distribution, correlation matrix, right ascension and declination, and KOI scores, valuable insights are gained. The findings reveal the prevalence of shorter orbital periods for confirmed planets, a bi-modal magnitude distribution, variations in stellar density based on celestial coordinates, and confidence levels of planet candidates.

This project demonstrates the ability to perform data analysis on customer reviews. It showcases skills in data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, spaCy, and Plotly. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights from text data, including the top 20 most used words and adjectives in the reviews. It highlights skills in NLP techniques, data manipulation, and generating visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiments and provide actionable insights for businesses.

## Machine Learning

### Dota 2 Match Outcome Prediction using CatBoost

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-Open%20in%20browser-blue)](https://degazzz.github.io/projects/Dota2CatBoost.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I developed a CatBoost Classifier model to predict outcomes of Dota 2 matches, a complex task due to the game's dynamic environment. Despite these challenges, my model showcased strong performance, achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.80Â±0.0053, indicating its ability to accurately differentiate between wins and losses. This project highlights my capability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios, providing reliable predictive insights.

## Software Development

### Data Guild GPT Telegram Bot

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in_Telegram-blue?logo=telegram)](https://t.me/dg_amabot)

<div style="text-align: justify">
Developed a whole Telegram bot for Aalto University's Data Guild internal chats written on <b>Python</b> using. Bot uses <b>API of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models</b> for various useful (and sometimes fun) features, as well <b>Stable Diffusion API</b> for Image Geneneration on a given prompt. Bot is hosted on Heroku. Some but not all of the features are - poll generation on a given prompt, image generation, making graphs on a given topic, answering any questions. In publicly available version of the bot messages are not collected and are not stored anywhere due to Code of Conduct and GDPR. However, internal test local version make usage of <b>Redis</b> for caching and preserving some sort of consistence in the dialog.
